Developing
-----------
This project is managed with Visual Studio, and is built as a 64-bit
application. However, it is structured in a way that is friendly to add build
setups from other environments. Here's the overall tree structure:

    +---build
    +---out
    |   +---x64
    |       +---Debug
    |       |   +---intermediate
    |       |       +---drives.tlog
    |       |
    |       +---Release
    |           +---intermediate
    |               +---drives.tlog
    +---src

The `build` directory contains all of the configuration for build tools. For
now, it just has the Visual Studio build environment and an nmake-style
makefile.

The `out` directory receives all generated build output (it's always safe to
delete the entire `out` directory).

The `src` directory contains source C++ files.
