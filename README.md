Building
----------
This project uses the CMake build tool. CMake is a meta-build system that locates and uses your
local development tools to build the project if possible.

To build, first install [CMake][https://cmake.org/]. Then go to the project root directory and run
the following command:

    cmake -B build

This will locate your installed development tools and configure your project build in the `build/`
directory. After that, whenever you want a new build, run this command:

    cmake --build build

This will build a debug version of the project, located in `build/Debug/`. To build a release
version, run

    cmake --build build --config release

You can find the built release executable in `build/Release/`.
