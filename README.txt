    drives: Prints information for active Windows drive letters


    DESCRIPTION

    This command-line tool prints the status of all active drive letters on
    Windows. It handles local drives, network-mapped drives, and removable
    drives. This command takes no arguments.


    BUILDING

    In the future I may convert this project to Visual Studio, but for now a
    simple makefile does just fine. The makefile is meant to be run with the
    Visual Studio 'nmake' command. Run 'nmake drives.exe' to build.
